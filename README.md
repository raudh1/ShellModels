# ShellModels

# to do 
- variance plot
- correlation times in different scales
- why forecast works
- evaluate critical exponents for different dataset to show better the perfomance improvement

# done
- check case 50k by splitting 100k dataset --- done and results are the same
- rewrite table with results
- firts impression on training LSTM for 12 with noise is that this approach obstruct the learning;
- in a std approach it seems to have an influence (to investigate)
